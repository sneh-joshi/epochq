// Message is the canonical, immutable unit of data in EpochQueue.

// Design rules:
//   - Message format is final. Only optional fields may be added. Never rename
//     or remove a field — existing persisted messages must always be readable.
//   - All timestamps are UTC milliseconds since Unix epoch.
//   - IDs are ULID strings: time-sortable, globally unique, cluster-safe.
//   - Term and LogIndex are populated by the WAL / Raft layer. In Phase 1
//     Term is always 0 and LogIndex is a monotone counter per queue.
